Dear Hani,

All the models and their relations hopefully are correct..


inside each model you will find  codo method definition...


think about them and give me your opinion


 one more thing,, I didn't test the relations but if you want to, don't test the relation from model A or model B

 go to model As_Bs after you create A and B... Then add or delete or you can Directly go to A/{id}/Bs or B/{id}/As



 hopefully will change this project ASAP..

 last thing before I forget, you should do  the :
 
 npm install loopback-connector-mongodb --save
 npm install
 
 becuase I did ignore them in the git ..
